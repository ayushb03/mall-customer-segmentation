## Customer Segmentation and Analysis 

This analysis delves into customer segmentation to uncover valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies. 

**1. Importing Libraries**

We'll begin by importing essential libraries for data manipulation and analysis.  Think of them as our trusty tools! 

**2. Exploration of Data**

Let's get to know our data better! We'll explore its structure, understand its characteristics, and identify any potential issues. ️‍♀️

**3. Data Visualization**

Visualization is key to uncovering patterns and relationships within the data. We'll create charts and graphs to bring the data to life! 

**4. Clustering using K-Means**

K-Means clustering is a powerful technique for grouping similar data points. We'll utilize this approach to segment our customers based on their characteristics. 

**5. Selection of Clusters **

Choosing the optimal number of clusters is crucial. We'll employ methods like the Elbow Method to determine the most fitting number of segments. 

**6. Plotting the Cluster Boundary and Clusters**

Once the clusters are defined, we'll visualize them on a graph, including their boundaries. This provides a clear picture of how the customers are segmented. 

**7. 3D Plot of Clusters**

For a more comprehensive view, we'll create a 3D plot to explore the relationships between customer attributes across different dimensions. 

**Distribution Plots:**

Let's delve deeper into the distribution of key variables:

* **Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score:** We'll examine how these factors are distributed within the customer base.  (Consider using histograms, boxplots, or violin plots)

**Plotting the Relation between Age, Annual Income and Spending Score:**

* **Scatter Plot:** We'll create a scatter plot to visualize the relationships between these three variables, revealing potential trends and correlations. 

**Segmentation using Annual Income and Spending Score:**

* **Elbow Method:** We'll utilize the Elbow Method to identify the optimal number of clusters based on annual income and spending score.  (Consider including a plot of the distortion metric vs. the number of clusters)
* **Clustering of the data:** We'll visually represent the resulting customer clusters based on their income and spending patterns.  (Consider using scatter plots with different colors for each cluster)
